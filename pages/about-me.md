![Thomas Camminady][3]

I am a PhD student at the [Steinbuch Centre for Computing](https://www.scc.kit.edu/) at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/) in the [Research Group Computational Science and Mathematical Methods](https://www.scc.kit.edu/ueberuns/rg-csmm.php).

Before coming to Karlsruhe, I studied Computational Engineering Science at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/). 

Here is my [CV][1]. 

You can write me aÂ [mail](mailto:thomas@camminady.org) if you like, here's my [public key][2].
